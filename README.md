# SE 3355 Web Development Final Project
## Hotel booking web application

I attempted to create a hotel reservation website for the final project of the SE 3355 Web Development course. For the backend part of my project, I used Django, and for the frontend, I used Bootstrap. The reason for 
choosing Django was my previous experience with it in other projects, and my familiarity with Django compared to other frameworks. Additionally, Django's ease of handling database operations and the convenience of its 
admin panel were factors that led me to choose Django. On the homepage of the website, users can explore existing hotels by clicking the 'Explore Hotel' button, and on the opened page, they can review the hotel's rating, 
features, nightly rate, and its location through the Google Maps integration. With the search section on the homepage, users can enter the location they want to stay, check-in and check-out dates, and the desired number of
rooms. After clicking the 'Search' button, they can select their hotels from the available options. To take advantage of the website's exclusive discounts, users can register on the site by clicking the 'Sign Up' button. 
Existing users can log in by clicking the 'Log In' button to avail themselves of the discounts. I faced challenges in various aspects of the project, especially during the implementation of the Google Maps integration, 
registration and login screens, and their validations. Since the required features were more complex and detailed compared to previous projects, I struggled with these aspects, relying on YouTube videos and exploring 
websites like Stack Overflow to find solutions. I also encountered difficulties during the deployment phase. I apologize as I couldn't deploy the project on PythonAnywhere due to errors encountered during my attempts. 
Overall, it was an enjoyable project where I learned a lot.
